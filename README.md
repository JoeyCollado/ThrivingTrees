# ThrivingTrees
# It is a Static Protoype website that I've developed in my 1st year of college as an entry to my school yearly hackathon competition which has won me a 1st place.
# The general concept of this web is to preserve trees and promote tree planting towards different communities, and it has a donation system in which an environmental organization will use to plant trees, which then will be documented in the web.
